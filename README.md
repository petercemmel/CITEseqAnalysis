# SingleCellAnalysis

This code was written as part of a project in the Meyer Lab at UCLA. The intent of this project was to provide an analysis of CITE-seq data on a single cell level, in order to identify means of increasing signaling specificity towards Tregs. Some code may make reference to other files in the repository which I did not include, due to them not being written entirely by myself.
